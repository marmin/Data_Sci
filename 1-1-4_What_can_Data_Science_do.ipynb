    "1- You work at an e-commerce company that sells three goods: widgets, doodads, and fizzbangs. The head of advertising asks you which they should feature in their new advertising campaign. You have data on individual visitors' sessions (activity on a website, pageviews, and purchases), as well as whether or not those users converted from an advertisement for that session. You also have the cost and price information for the goods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer : \n",
    "for these three goods, I would look at the page views and purchase statistics. If the page view for a good is high but the purchase is not high, it shows that there isi interest in buying that good but it is expensive, then I would look at the cost and price of the good to see if we can reduce the price compared to cost.

    "2- You work at a web design company that offers to build websites for clients. Signups have slowed, and you are tasked with finding out why. The onboarding funnel has three steps: email and password signup, plan choice, and payment. On a user level you have information on what steps they have completed as well as timestamps for all of those events for the past 3 years. You also have information on marketing spend on a weekly level.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: I would look at the timestamps for the different three steps of the clients then compare the statistics with the history recorded for that step to understand which step is much more time consuming\n",
    "I would also look at the marketing load to see if it was the cause of slow down or not. "
